# Pythagorean tuning method

I started learning the piano when I was 3 years old. When I was an toddler, I often complained that learning and playing the piano was too hard due to too many tones in an octave, and I believed there must be a kiddie version of the piano that has fewer number of tones per octave. Later in the lower grades of elementary school, I wondered why each octave has 12 tones, not 5, 10 nor 15. 

So, when I was a 3rd grader, I learned about the [Pythagorean tuning method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning) and conducted experiments by coding it with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). See the [Scratch.org project page](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/243436547) or find a sb3 file in the [scratch folder](scratch/). I finally understood at that time why it must be 12 rather than 5, 10 and 15. I also learned that musicians agree on 12 although 53 tones per octave is a better choice than 12 per octave, mathematically and musically speaking.

I wrote this Scrartch code in August 2018 to work on a summer research project about the Pythagorean tuning method. See a research report and a [poster presentation](images/poster.jpg), both written in Japanese, if you can read Japanese. :smile:
